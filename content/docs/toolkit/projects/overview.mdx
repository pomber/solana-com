Choose from one of the below scaffolds to generate a new project workspace:

- [Anchor](#anchor) - A popular Rust-based framework for creating Solana smart
  contracts.
- [`create-solana-program`](#create-solana-program) - In-depth workspace
  generator for either Anchor smart contract development or Native smart
  contract, including JavaScript and Rust clients.
- [Web App Templates](#web-app-template) - Generator for new projects that
  connects a Solana smart contract to various frontend stacks, includes wallet
  connector setup.

## Anchor

```shell
anchor init
```

This generates a basic workspace to be able to write an Anchor rust smart
contracts, build, test, and deploy. For more information, read the
[`anchor init` doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/anchor-init).

## Create Solana Program

```shell
npx create-solana-program
```

This generates an in-depth workspace for either Anchor smart contract
development or Native smart contract development with either a Javascript
Client, Rust Client, or both. For more information, read the
[`create-solana-program` doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/solana-program).

## Web App Template

```shell
npx create-solana-dapp
```

This initializes a new project that connects a Solana smart contract to a
typescript frontend with a wallet connector. For more information, read the
[web app template doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/web-app).

## Mobile App Template

```shell
yarn create expo-app --template @solana-mobile/solana-mobile-expo-template
```

This is initializing a new project using the Expo framework that is specifically
designed for creating mobile applications that interact with the Solana
blockchain.

## Update an Existing Project

```shell
npx create-solana-program
```

You can add the Solana program scaffold to an existing project by following this
[guide](/docs/toolkit/projects/existing-project).

## Standard Project Layouts

For best practices on smart contract file structure, read this
[guide](/docs/toolkit/projects/project-layout).
