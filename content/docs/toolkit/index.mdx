The Solana Program development toolkit is published as the
[`mucho` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mucho). The `mucho` command
will be used to run most of the Solana program development tools - _mucho tools,
one cli_.

You can contribute to this
[Toolkit book on GitHub](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/tree/main/docs/toolkit).
