  Learn how to read data from the Solana blockchain network. This guide covers
  fetching wallet accounts, program accounts, and token mint accounts using
  JavaScript/TypeScript, with practical examples using the Solana web3.js
  library.

Now, let's explore how to read data from the Solana network. We'll fetch a few
different accounts to understand the structure of a Solana account.

On Solana, all data is contained in what we call "accounts". You can think of
data on Solana as a public database with a single "Accounts" table, where each
entry in this table is an individual account.

Accounts on Solana can store "state" or "executable" programs, all of which can
be thought of as entries in the same "Accounts" table. Each account has an
"address" (public key) that serves as its unique ID used to locate its
corresponding on-chain data.

Solana accounts contain either:

- State: This is data that's meant to be read from and persisted. It could be
  information about tokens, user data, or any other type of data defined within
  a program.
- Executable Programs: These are accounts that contain the actual code of Solana
  programs. They contain the instructions that can be executed on the network.

This separation of program code and program state is a key feature of Solana's
Account Model. For more details, refer to the
[Solana Account Model](/docs/core/accounts) page.

## Fetch Playground Wallet

Let's start by looking at a familiar account - your own Playground Wallet! We'll
fetch this account and examine its structure to understand what a basic Solana
account looks like.

### Open Example 3

Click this [link](https://beta.solpg.io/6671c9aecffcf4b13384d19a) to open the
example in Solana Playground. You'll see this code:

```ts filename="client.ts" {3}
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const address = new PublicKey("C33qt1dZGZSsqTrHdtLKXPZNoxs6U1ZBfyDkzmj6mXeR");
const accountInfo = await pg.connection.getAccountInfo(address);

console.log(JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
```

In this example, we'll fetch the address of an existing Mint account on devnet.
