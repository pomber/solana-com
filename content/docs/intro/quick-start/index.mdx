Welcome to the Solana Quick Start Guide! This hands-on guide will introduce you
to the core concepts for building on Solana, regardless of your prior
experience. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a basic foundation in
Solana development and be ready to explore more advanced topics.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn about:

- Understanding Accounts: Explore how data is stored on the Solana network.
- Sending Transactions: Learn to interact with the Solana network by sending
  transactions.
- Building and Deploying Programs: Create your first Solana program and deploy
  it to the network.
- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs): Learn how to use PDAs to create
  deterministic addresses for accounts.
- Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs): Learn how to make your programs interact
  with other programs on Solana.

The best part? You don't need to install anything! We'll be using Solana
Playground, a browser-based development environment, for all our examples. This
means you can follow along, copy and paste code, and see results immediately,
all from your web browser. Basic programming knowledge is helpful but not
required.

Let's dive in and start building on Solana!

## Solana Playground

Solana Playground (Solpg) is a browser-based development environment that allows
you to quickly develop, deploy, and test Solana programs!

Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to https://beta.solpg.io/.
