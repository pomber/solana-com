This section covers the steps to set up your local environment for Solana
development.

## Install Dependencies

- Windows users must first install WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) and then
  install the dependencies specified in the Linux section below.
- Linux users should first install the dependencies specified in the Linux
  section below.
- Mac users should start with the Rust installation instructions below.

### Solana Config

To see your current config:

```shell
solana config get
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Config File: /Users/test/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

The RPC URL and Websocket URL specific the Solana cluster the CLI will make
requests to. By default this will be mainnet-beta.

You can update the Solana CLI cluster using the following commands:

```
solana config set --url mainnet-beta
solana config set --url devnet
solana config set --url localhost
solana config set --url testnet
```

You can also use the following short options:

```
solana config set -um    # For mainnet-beta
solana config set -ud    # For devnet
solana config set -ul    # For localhost
solana config set -ut    # For testnet
```

The Keypair Path specifies the location of the default wallet used by the Solana
CLI (to pay transaction fees and deploy programs). The default path is
`~/.config/solana/id.json`. The next step walks through how to generate a
keypair at the default location.

### Create Wallet

To interact with the Solana network using the Solana CLI, you need a Solana
wallet funded with SOL.

To generate a keypair at the default Keypair Path, run the following command:

```shell
solana-keygen new
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrae NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
===========================================================================
pubkey: 8dBTPrjnkXyuQK3KDt9wrZBfizEZijmmUQXVHpFbVwGT
===========================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:
cream bleak tortoise ocean nasty game gift forget fancy salon mimic amazing
===========================================================================
```

Once a keypair is generated, you can get the address (public key) of the keypair
with the following command:

```shell
solana address
```

### Airdrop SOL

Once you've set up your local wallet, request an airdrop of SOL to fund your
wallet. You need SOL to pay for transaction fees and to deploy programs.

Set your cluster to the devnet:

```shell
solana config set -ud
```

Then request an airdrop of devnet SOL:

```shell
solana airdrop 2
```

To check your wallet's SOL balance, run the following command:

```shell
solana balance
```

### Run Local Validator

The Solana CLI comes with the
[test validator](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/examples/test-validator)
built-in. Running a local validator will allow you to deploy and test your
programs locally.

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start a local validator:

```shell
solana-test-validator
```
