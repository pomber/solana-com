## Summary

- **Wallets** store your secret key and allow users to sign transactions
- **Hardware wallets** store your secret key on a separate device
- **Software wallets** use your computer for secure storage. On desktops,
  software wallets are often **browser extensions** that add the ability to
  connect to a wallet from a website. On mobile, wallet apps have their own
  browsers.
- Solana's **Wallet Adapter** allows you to build websites that can request a
  user's wallet address and propose transactions for them to sign

## Lesson

### Wallets

In the previous two lessons, we discussed keypairs. Keypairs are used to locate
accounts and sign transactions. While the public key of a keypair is perfectly
safe to share, the secret key should always be kept in a secure location. If a
user's secret key is exposed, then a malicious actor could execute transactions
with the authority of that user, allowing them to transfer all the assets
inside.

A “wallet” refers to anything that stores a secret key to keep it secure. These
secure storage options can generally be described as either “hardware” or
“software” wallets. Hardware wallets are storage devices that are separate from
your computer. Software wallets are applications you can install on your
existing device(s).

- On mobile, software wallets are typically mobile apps, installed through the
  iOS App Store or Google Play. These include their own web browsers.
- On desktop, software wallets often come in the form of a browser extension.

Both techniques allow websites to interact easily with the wallet, for example:

1. Seeing the wallet's wallet address (their public key)
2. Submitting transactions for a user's approval to sign
3. Sending signed transactions to the network

Signing transactions requires using your secret key. By letting a site submit a
transaction to your wallet and having the wallet handle the signing, you ensure
that you never expose your secret key to the website. Instead, you only share
the secret key with the wallet application.

Unless you're creating a wallet application yourself, your code should never
need to ask a user for their secret key. Instead, you can ask users to connect
to your site using a reputable wallet.

## Solana's Wallet Adapter

If you build web apps, and need users to be able to connect to their wallets and
sign transactions through your apps, you'll want Solana's Wallet Adapter. Wallet
Adapter is a suite of modular packages:

- The core functionality is found in `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`.
- React support is added by `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`.
- Additional packages provide components for common UI frameworks. In this
  lesson, and throughout this course, we'll be using components from
  `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

Finally, some packages are adapters for specific wallet apps. These are now no
longer necessary in most cases - see below.

### Install Wallet-Adapter Libraries for React

When adding wallet support to an existing React app, you start by installing the
appropriate packages. You'll need `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`,
`@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. If you plan to use the provided React
components, you'll also need to add `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

All wallets that support the
[Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard) are
supported out of the box, and all the popular Solana wallets support the Wallet
Standard. However, if you wish to add support for any wallets that don't support
the standard, add a package for them.

```
npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-base \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui
```
